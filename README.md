NuadPah Project

Overview

The NuadPah Project is a comprehensive application designed to teach massage techniques using Artificial Intelligence. It provides a user-friendly interface for users to learn and practice effective massage techniques, focusing on relieving specific muscle groups. The app delivers personalized guidance and feedback based on detected hand and body positions, ensuring correct application of the techniques.

The project consists of two main components:

Frontend: Built using Flutter for a smooth and responsive cross-platform experience.

Backend: Developed with TypeScript (using ES6 syntax) and Express for a robust and scalable API.

Features

Frontend

Built with Flutter, offering a seamless and interactive user interface.

Cross-platform support for both Android and iOS.

Visual guides for selecting massage techniques.

Real-time feedback using AI-driven key point detection.

Backend

Developed using TypeScript (ES6) and Express.js.

APIs for:

User authentication and profile management.

Storing and retrieving massage technique data.

AI-based feedback generation using key point detection algorithms.

Integrates with external AI models to analyze user hand and body positions in real-time.

Project Workflow

Select a Technique: Users choose a massage technique tailored to specific muscle groups.

AI Guidance: The AI generates key body points and hand placement guides.

Real-Time Feedback: Using key point detection, the AI provides feedback on the user's hand positions and movements to ensure proper application.

Progress Tracking: The app tracks user progress and improvements over time.

Technologies Used

Frontend

Flutter: For building a responsive and visually appealing user interface.

Backend

TypeScript: Leveraging modern ES6 features for enhanced readability and maintainability.

Express.js: A fast and minimalist web framework for creating RESTful APIs.

AI Models: Key point detection models for analyzing user movements.

Body Parser & CORS: For handling API requests and cross-origin access.

Dotenv: To manage environment variables securely.
